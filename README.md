# EMessage
TCP Messaging with a server oriented system.

  Use an EMessage Client to connect, log in, fetch, send, and clear messages on an EMessage Server. An EMessage Client can send a message to any EMessage user on any EMessage server.

  Note, you will have to enable port forwarding for EMessage Server to be accessible to everyone on the internet. The default port in 300, though you can modify it in the source code.
